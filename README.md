**Status**: Heavy development (you might run into crashes as the library is being developed, sorry in advance).

This is an instance of my [**tysoc**](https://github.com/wpumacay/tysocCore) framework for locomotion, 
using [**MuJoCo**](http://mujoco.org) as physics backend. As explained in the core repository, the idea
is to provide a kind of abstraction layer on top of various physics backends, and allow you to just
focus on making your experiment regardless of the details of each specific backend.

I will be adding more documentation as I develop the library, and sorry in advance as I might forget 
to update the docs from time to time. However, one main objective is to write comprehensive documentation, 
and I will be doing it on the go. If you have any suggestions/issues, just post an issue or contact me 
at wpumacay@gmail.com .
